# HackXperience Project: Smarter Gifting through GiftFrenz – Reimagining the Joy of Giving 🎁

## 🚀 Overview

This repository contains the code and assets from our submission to an **open hackathon** focused on improving the gift-giving experience through technology.

### 🧠 The Challenge: Making Gifting Smarter

**Mission Brief:**
Gift-giving should be joyful, not stressful. This hackathon called on participants to build a solution that tackles common frustrations — from duplicate presents and forgotten dates to wasteful, unwanted gifts.

**Quest Objective:**
Develop a working prototype that enhances the gifting experience for individuals, families, or companies. Solutions could include:

- 📜 Seamless wishlist creation and sharing
- 👥 Better coordination for group gifts
- 🧠 Smart tech like AI to personalize gift discovery
- 🛍️ Smooth integration with e-commerce platforms
- 🌍 Eco-conscious designs that reduce gift waste

Our team set out to create a solution that hit these goals with usability, empathy, and tech-forward thinking.

## 💡 About the Project

Our application (details in the `/src` folder) is a gifting coordination platform that uses simple UX and intelligent recommendation logic to help users:

- Create & manage gift wishlists effortlessly
- Coordinate group gifting with minimal hassle
- Use AI suggestions based on users wishlist and interests
- Ensure gifts are meaningful — not just material

We focused on **user accessibility and real-world usability**, envisioning a tool for everyone — whether tech-savvy or not.

## 🧑‍💻 About the Hackathon

This was **an open hackathon** — open to anyone, from any background. What made this experience particularly valuable was the **diversity** of participants.

### 🎓 Competing Beyond Boundaries

Despite having a **bachelor’s degree**, I was up against incredibly talented individuals, many of whom were:
- Current master’s students from **renowned institutions like the National University of Singapore (NUS)**
- Graduates
- Year 1 - 3 students from different universities

Rather than seeing this as a barrier, I saw it as motivation. I brought everything I had — skills, creativity, persistence — to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with peers from top-tier institutions.

I'm proud to say that I held my own, and came out of the experience **stronger, sharper, and more inspired**.

Hackathons like this remind me why I love tech — not just for what we can build, but who we can become in the process. Competing with people from prestigious academic and professional backgrounds didn't intimidate me — it energized me.
